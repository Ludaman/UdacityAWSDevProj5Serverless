# Serverless TODO Project for Jeff Choate

I expect the grader to use the APIID and react front end to connect to this application.

# Functionality of the application

This application will allow creating/removing/updating/fetching TODO items. Each TODO item can optionally have an attachment image. Each user only has access to TODO items that he/she has created.

All functions should be working and deployed to the cloud.

# testing

All functions were tested with Postman and via the frontend throughout development.
